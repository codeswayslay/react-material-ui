# REACT MATERIAL UI
Application that demonstrates the use of the material-ui library in react.

Also contains great examples on the separation of contents into components, use of the react context API to store props, state, and functions, and distribute them across (a wonderful way to avoid props drilling).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
